I wrote the code and it seemed like it should have worked but it didn't for some reason. |

I got it working for the smallest test case, but for the other one it currently doesn't work unfortunately so I'll need to do some more debugging. |
| November 16th | 2:55 - 3:20pm  | I worked some more and basically rewrote a lot of my compressor code and actually managed to get it working. I think the issue I was having was that I wasn't carrying over the "nextBit" variable into subsequent runs through my main while loop, and that would mess things up when there were switches from 0 to 1 (that's my theory at least). After making it carry over this next bit and set it as the initial bit for the next block, it started working. I also added a check for if the length would overflow the allocated number of bits for length storage and this allows me to only allocate 8 bits per block but still handle cases where there is a higher length than can be handled by that (it'll just make a new block). This helped my compression ratio, especially on the smaller test cases. |

I'm having some issues with how you write out an empty block if you want to start with 1s and also if there is a run that goes over what BLOCK_SIZE bits can hold. I'll try to fix it tonight most likely if I have time. Update: I realized I was writing out my empty block BEFORE I wrote out my length for that sequence that overflowed. This was messing everything up but I figured out a way to fix it thankfully and now it works. |
