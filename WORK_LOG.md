| April 5       |     9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| November 15th | 2:30 - 3:00pm  |                                                                                            I began working on an idea I had to solve it where I separate up "blocks" of bits based on if they are a 1 or 0. I wrote the code and it seemed like it should have worked but it didn't for some reason. |
| November 16th | 9:50 - 10:15am | I continued working to try to fix my code and after refactoring the compress method to fix an issue where the next bit variable would be skipped. I got it working for the smallest test case, but for the other one it currently doesn't work unfortunately so I'll need to do some more debugging. |
